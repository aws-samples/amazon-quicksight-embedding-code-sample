# QuickSight Embedding

## :bulb: Overview
With Amazon QuickSight embedded analytics, you can seamlessly integrate data-driven experiences into your software applications. You can style the embedded components to match your brand. This capability brings the power of QuickSight to your end users, where they can analyze and interact with data without ever leaving the application. Improving the user experience by reducing cognitive complexity gives users a better opportunity for deeper understanding and effectiveness.

**In this code sample, we will take a deeper dive into this multi-tenant [Embedding Demo](https://www.oktank.poweredbyquicksight.aws.dev/).  1/ The backend Lambda functions that are being called to embed various QuickSight resources and 2/ The front-end React component that handles the embedding session.**

:no_good: *Disclaimer: This code sample is meant for demo purposes only. In a production environment, you will want to give least privelege access to your Lambda functions and configure additional security measures wherever necessary.*
