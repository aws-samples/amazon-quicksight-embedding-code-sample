With Amazon QuickSight embedded analytics, you can seamlessly integrate data-driven experiences into your software applications. You can style the embedded components to match your brand. This capability brings the power of QuickSight to your end users, where they can analyze and interact with data without ever leaving the application. Improving the user experience by reducing cognitive complexity gives users a better opportunity for deeper understanding and effectiveness.

**In this code sample, we will dive deep into the front-end and back-end code that powers this multi-tenant [Embedding Demo](https://www.oktank.poweredbyquicksight.aws.dev/).**

:no_good: *Disclaimer: This code sample is meant for demo purposes only. In a production environment, you will want to give least privilege access to your Lambda functions and configure additional security measures wherever necessary.*
